# Rabin Karp Search Algorithm

A Javascript implemenation of the [Rabin-Karp Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)

It can be used for detecting occurances of a string in another string. Can be
used to detect plagarism. Note I advise not to use this algo, iteratively
calling `indexOf` yields better performance in V8.

## Tests
run `npm test`
